/**
 * the cost of a stock on each day is given in an array
 * find the max profit that you can make by buying and selling in those days
 * Example
 * input = 100,180,260,310,40,535,695
 * then the max profit can be made by
 * buying on day 0 and selling on day 3 = 310-100 = 210
 * +
 * buying on day 4 and selling on day 6 = 695-40 = 655
 * total = 655+210=865
 * <p>
 * can we buy and sell on the same day? say there was a 40 before 100.. then we can make one more profit of 60
